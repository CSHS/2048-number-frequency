This was made out of pure curiosity.  I downloaded 2048-hard from GitHub and wanted to see how often each tile of the same value shows up after some number of iterations of running the AI-controlled "auto-run" mode.  By observing the frequency of each number, one can analyze how the AI works for such a game, and in addition, discover if after repeated runs the number of tiles of some value exhibits an asymptotic behavior.  I didn't want to get rid of the animation, so what I did was I made the animation speed up. 
The way this works is you have to click "auto-run," and a dialog box will come up asking for the number of iterations to run "auto-run."  And the array of frequency should come up in the javascript "console" when you "inspect element."
